### Hi there! 👋
.
I'm a Fullstack Developer with 1 year of experience, currently working as a free lance developer.
💭 also a Photographer, Fimmaker and drone operator. 

🚀 Honestly just creating and making things happen. 🚀

👨‍💻 A dynamic and ambitious person. Really passionate about learning & teaching, searching always for things to challenge myself, and never stop growing.

✨Bridging the gap between design and development. From photography to programming - I began my coding journey by teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I then attended SoyHenry, a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Coming from a creative background, I have always been drawn to the Front End. I enjoy CSS, design thinking, UX, and working with design systems.✨

🧙‍♂️ When not coding or shooting some frames (rarely), I'm also interested in Copywriting, Branding, and Marketing.

👾 Curious fact: I'm a BIG fan of the 80s and 90s Cyberpunk aesthetic.
